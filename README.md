# sym4processing - various simulation resources in processing

Processing files supporting various simulation applications and giving them 
selected possibilities and properties:

* __Cellular Automata__ application design template
* Design template for an __ABM__ simulation application with the possibility of 
  expanding with a network structure, suitable for many purposes
* Network game template for **one server - many clients** games
* Additional tool codes for working with application templates 
* Sample simulations written using these templates
* As a submodule, it imports a repository with materials for the course 
  "Processing in education and simulation" (**bookProcessingPL**)

More documentation is in the source files, prepared to generate documentation 
in the Doxygen format. Just use *docs/_make_docs.sh* and then see *doxDocs/* .

## REPOSITORY CLONING

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/borkowsk/sym4processing.git
```

## DEPENDENCIES

You need to install "com.hamoid" library for **Processing** and "ffmpeg" 
application.
