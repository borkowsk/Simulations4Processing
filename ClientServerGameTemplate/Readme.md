# *"Molecular paradigm"* network game template

## Public, basic version of network game template. Part of GuestXR UE grant (https://guestxr.eu/)

1. Defines common game and protocol components, as well as server and client applications.
2. The network protocol is text-based for easier error-catching.
3. Common source files are symbolically linked from the *gameCommon* directory (use *link_commons.sh* or *link_commons.bat*!)
4. Source files are documented in 'Doxygen' format. Just use *docs/_make_docs.sh* and then see *doxDocs/* .

This template was tested under **UBUNTU 20.x** and **Windows 11** with **bash** (!), but documentation only under UBUNTU.
